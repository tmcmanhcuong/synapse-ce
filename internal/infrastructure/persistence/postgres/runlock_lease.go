// LeaseRunLock implements ports.RunLocker via a jobs_run_lock ROW lease instead of a session
// advisory lock. Unlike RunLock it does NOT hold a pooled connection for the duration of the
// run – each operation borrows a connection transiently – so N concurrent runs cannot starve
// the pool (the ≤8-default-pool hazard the hostile review flagged). A background renewer
// extends the lease while the run is live; a crash lets the lease expire so another worker can
// reclaim it. Used for RECON; the agent SESSION lock stays the advisory RunLock (it must not
// expire mid-LLM-loop). owner is a process id; each acquisition derives a distinct owner token
// so concurrent loops cannot renew or release one another's row.
